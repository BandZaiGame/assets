  "description": "BandZa誰 is a card game set in a dream world where Za誰s, magical beings, engage in battles using elements and a unique shifumi style battle system. Players can own and level up their Za誰 NFTs, earn rewards and experience by participating in fights and working at different centers. Za誰 eggs of varying rarities can be purchased from Nurseries controlled by other players, or on NFT marketplaces. The game emphasizes security and decentralization, with a focus on a balanced token economy. Regular updates, events, and tournaments are planned to build a strong community of ZAIs masters.",
